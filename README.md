# GeneralImprovements

Everything is mostly configurable and improves (IMO) several things about the game, with more to come:

<ul>
	<li>Places newly picked up items in the hotbar in left-right order. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Rearranges hotbar items when dropping things. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Always puts two-handed items in slot 1 (makes selling things a bit faster). May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Decreases the time required in between scrolling through inventory slots. Configurable.</li>
	<li>Decreases the time required in between placing items on the company counter.</li>
	<li>Removes the wait to begin typing at the terminal when activating it.</li>
</ul>

It also fixes the following minor bugs:

<ul>
	<li>Stops all non-scrap objects from showing value (when scanned and sold) when they do not actually have any.</li>
</ul>

This pairs well with my other mod, <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ShaosilGaming/FlashlightFix/">FlashlightFix</a>

I will probably keep adding to this as I see minor things that could be improved or fixed.

### WARNING

Because this mod can shift inventory slots around, if you play with people who do NOT also have this mod installed, the slots they are aware about on your character may be different, and as a result, they may not see you holding what you actually are.
