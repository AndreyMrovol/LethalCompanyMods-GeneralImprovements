# GeneralImprovements

This mod is mostly configurable and improves (IMO) several things about the game, with more to come:

<ul>
	<li>Places newly picked up items in the hotbar in left-right order. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Rearranges hotbar items when dropping things. May be disabled in config.</li>
</ul>

It also fixes the following minor bugs:

<ul>
	<li>Stops keys from showing value when they do not actually have any.</li>
</ul>

This pairs well with my other mod, <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ShaosilGaming/FlashlightFix/">FlashlightFix</a>

I will probably keep adding to this as I see minor things that could be improved or fixed.
