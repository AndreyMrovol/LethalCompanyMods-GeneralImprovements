# GeneralImprovements

Everything is mostly configurable and improves (IMO) several things about the game, with more to come:

<ul>
	<li>Places newly picked up items in the hotbar in left-right order. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Rearranges hotbar items when dropping things. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Always puts two-handed items in slot 1 (makes selling things a bit faster). May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>Decreases the time required in between scrolling through inventory slots. Configurable.</li>
	<li>Decreases the time required in between placing items on the company counter.</li>
	<li>Removes the wait to begin typing at the terminal when activating it.</li>
	<li>Skips the "bootup" menu animation when launching the game. May be disabled in config.</li>
	<li>If specified in the config, the game will automatically select ONLINE or LAN upon launch.</li>
	<li>Using the up/down arrow keys at the terminal will navigate through the previous (n) commands. (n) may range from 0-100 in the config.</li>
	<li>Using the left/right arrow keys at the terminal while viewing the radar will quickly cycle through available targets.</li>
</ul>

It also fixes the following minor bugs:

<ul>
	<li>Stops all non-scrap objects from showing value (when scanned and sold) when they do not actually have any.</li>
	<li>Removes the random 'n' in the middle-left of the terminal monitor when switching through radar cams.</li>
</ul>

This pairs well with my other mod, <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ShaosilGaming/FlashlightFix/">FlashlightFix</a>

I will probably keep adding to this as I see minor things that could be improved or fixed.

### WARNING

Because this mod can shift inventory slots around, if you play with people who do NOT also have this mod installed, the slots they are aware about on your character may be different, and as a result, they may not see you holding what you actually are.
